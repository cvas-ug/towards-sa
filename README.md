Source code for Towards Artificial Robotic Self-Awareness

## Abstract

While humans are aware of their body and capabilities, robots are not. To address this, we present in this paper the first step towards an artificial self-aware architecture for dual-arm robots. Our approach is inspired by human self-awareness developmental levels and serves as the underlying building block for a robot to achieve awareness of itself while carrying out tasks in an environment. Our assumption is that a robot has to know itself before interacting with the environment in order to be able to support different robotic tasks. Hence, we developed a neural network architecture to enable a robot to know itself by differentiating its limbs from different environments using visual and proprioception sensory inputs. we demonstrate experimentally that a robot can distinguish itself with an accuracy of ~89% from four different uncluttered and cluttered environmental settings and under confounding and adversarial input signals.
